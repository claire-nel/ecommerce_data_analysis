# ecommerce_data_analysis
In this project I analyzed e-commerce sales with SQL. I created a data pipeline that tracks revenue by category, customer habits, payment behavior, and time-segmentation. Includes data type conversions, debug queries, and clean aggregation logic. I then visualized the data using the python libraries Matplotlib and Seaborn.
